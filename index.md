## About Me

I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the Visual Display division of Samsung Electronics, South Korea. I graduated from Computer Science and Engineering department at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. In my final year I worked with Prof. Preethi Jyothi on generative models for code-switched and Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan (along with Prof. Jyothi) on meta learning for multilingual multitask setup.
