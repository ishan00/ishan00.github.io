## About Me

I am a final year undergrad in the computer science department at IIT Bombay. I am working with [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) on generative models for code-switched text for my undergraduate thesis. I am glad to be part of the ISMP (Institute Student Mentorship Program) team for this year.
You can find me on codechef([ishan_00](https://www.codechef.com/users/ishan_00)) and codeforces([ishan00](https://codeforces.com/profile/ishan00))
